Hi! I am a PhD student at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu) working on 3D computer vision, advised by [Prof. James Hays](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/). I am currently also a research intern at [Niantic Spatial](https://www.nianticspatial.com/). I am excited about Spatial AI: models that understand the 3D world from visual data. I enjoy working on research at the intersection of 3D geometry, deep learning, and optimization.

Prior to this, I worked on long-range perception problems for autonomous driving at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/). I have also been a student researcher at Google DeepMind. I earned my Master's from Georgia Tech in 2020, during which I worked on [SfM problems](https://github.com/borglab/gtsfm) with [Prof. Frank Dellaert](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/). I was also part of a wonderful team from the [RAIL lab](http://rail.gatech.edu/) that won the [FetchIt! challenge](https://youtu.be/vh34WuWuIac) at ICRA 2019.

Please feel free to send me an email if you're interested in research collaborations!
