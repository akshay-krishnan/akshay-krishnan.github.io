Hi! I am a PhD student at [Georgia Tech](https://gatech.edu) working on 3D computer vision, advised by [Prof. James Hays](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/). I am also a student researcher at Google Research. I believe that understanding the 3D world from visual data is key to both generalizable autonomous systems and virtual reality. I enjoy working on this problem at the intersection of geometry, machine learning, and optimization. 

Prior to this, I worked on long-range perception problems for autonomous driving at [Waymo](https://waymo.com/). I earned my Master's from Georgia Tech in 2020, during which I worked with [Prof. Frank Dellaert](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dellaert/) on SfM problems using [GTSAM](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam). I also worked with the [RAIL lab](http://rail.gatech.edu/) during the [FetchIt! challenge](https://ic.gatech.edu/news/622859/georgia-tech-team-wins-new-fetch-robot-icras-fetchit-mobile-manipulation-challenge) at ICRA 2019. I spent a wonderful summer as an intern at [Blue River Technology](https://bluerivertechnology.com/), which also taught me a bit about agriculture.

Please feel free to send me an email if you're interested in research collaborations!
